But it also ... doesn't have any heart. Haha. But for real, I don't believe for a second that any of them have their heart in this song. Should have been the B-side to Fly on the Windscreen instead of the other way around. I wonder how this song would have been received if it was originally on Some Great Reward?</div>

On one hand, it feels more dated that the other songs on the album to me. It's still a strong tune, just hard to isolate it from the thousands of times I've heard it. The melodic synth fill (1:23) seems fresh, but I'm struggling to hear anything new here. My brain knows this is a solid song.</div>

There is a heavy emphasis on guitars and, often, a loud, exhausting bass. It would be nice to introduce those instruments as support and not feature on every song. I like this song, but it's all about the guitar.</div>

It's deeper, and I can't help but think that if he were able to sing this a little higher, this would be a great song, instead of a merely good one. It's probably age—happens to all of us.

It's a surprisingly simple arrangement: bass, synth pad, drums. It works really well. I've only just noticed that it ends on the piano chord that starts Stripped. So that was probably the first and last sound on that side of the record.</div>

                <div class="comment-container">Probably controversial, but this was never a favorite of mine. I have come to appreciate the way it starts the album off though, and there is a lot to like in the song. It doesn't have the same lush-but-dark fullness that other songs on this album have. It stands apart as a very good song, but without the substance that the rest of Violator brings.</div>
                <div class="version-container">I'm going off script a little here. Cicada Mix is a fresh take on this song that works really well. It doesn't resolve any of the issues that I have with the song, but as a variation, it's relevant.</div>

Builds, deconstructs, rebuilds. Lots of interesting sounds and great drums. However, I don't like the way Dave's voice is being utilized.

Make it a little less about the bass, and more about those high, soft pads. And don't dive into the glitchy, compressed vocals. All that noise is detracting from a very pretty ballad.</div>

                <div class="version-container">The SixToes Remix is kind of incredible in how it reinterprets the song. It's a different but‚ somehow, even more impressive song. But it edits out the magnificent chorus until the very end, and even then chops out much of it. Why they would make THAT choice? No idea. Criminal.</div>

It's a complete picture. There is nothing missing, nothing in excess. It's basically perfect.</div>

It's a legitimately incredible song. There is so much to be said about it: both Dave and Martin sound great, the melody is catchy, the production is tight and beautiful. It would have been nice if the video were better, but that's a nit pick for sure. It's a classic.</div>
                <div class="version-container">I fought with this choice. My heart really wants the Quad Final Mix. I would listen to this on repeat for hours.
